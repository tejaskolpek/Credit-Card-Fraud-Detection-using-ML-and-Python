# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-ML-and-Python
develop a Credit Card Fraud Detection model to categorize a transaction as Fraud or Legitimate with very high accuracy using different Machine Learning Models. This is a hands-on project where step-by-step process done for creating and evaluating a machine learning model.
 - Data Science: Credit Card Fraud Detection – Model Building
 - Analyzing and understanding the data.
 - Techniques for preparing data for use.
 - Using Logistic Regression, KNN, Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM models, you can make a model.
 - KFolds that are repeated and KFolds that have been grouped together.
 - SMOTE and ADASYN are three random oversamplers, and they all work.
 - Metrics for Classification.
